% The Purpose Of The Script And The Input Parameters 
% This script is provided for the accurate estimation of landslide-event
% magnitude. We used Matlab R2015b to test the given script. It requires 
% three input parameters: cutoff (smallest area that follows power law) 
% and beta (power-law exponent) values of Frequency-size distribution 
% of landslides, and a horizontal array (Area) with landslide sizes.  

% The power-law distribution can be captured in both cumulative and 
% non-cumulative FADs, and the power-law exponent for a non-cumulative 
% FAD (β) can be transferred to its cumulative equivalent, α, using 
% the relation α=β-1 (Guzzetti et al., 2002). In this code, the calculations 
% are carried out on the non-cumulative FAD.

% The cutoff is the landslide size where frequency-size distribution curve
% diverges form the power-law. In this code its unit is meter square.

% Beta value resfers to the slope of the frequency-size distribution. 
% It also called as power-law exponent (scaling parameter, β). 
% For most landslide inventories, non-cumulative power-law exponents occur
% in the range of 1.4–3.4, with a central tendency of 2.3–2.5 
% (Stark and Guzzetti, 2009; Van Den Eeckhaut et al., 2007).

% The unit of landslide sizes are in meter square.

% To obtain the cutoff and beta values the method suggested by Clauset 
% et al.(2009) should be used. The original script of Clauset et al. (2009)
% can be downloaded from the following link to calculate these parameters: 
% http://www.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/ 

% The Output Of The Script
% When you run the mLS function, for the given sample data, the corresponding 
% mLS (landslide-event magnitude) will be obtained. As an output of this code, 
% a plot showing the frequency-area distribution of the given landslides and 
% the corresponding power-law fit are also obtained. mLS does not have any unit.

% In the following lines, the bins are defined with an array. We took 2 as 
% the minimum bin size and we used increasing bin sizes. We increase the 
% bin widths while the landslide size increases, so that bin widths become
% approximately equal in logarithmic coordinates. To create a long array for 
% the bins we tentatively pick 120 for the size of x1 vector defined below.
